# dbautils
a bunch of db scripts

It's basically a dump of scripts collected along the way devided into folders according to the DB.
(I've started this after I found myself writing the same scripts for the 10th time :) )

Currently have folders for:
- Oracle
- Mongo
- Postgres
- Vertica
- MySQL

There's also a folder for general Linux scripts I found useful names `bin`.

feel free to pull & donate scripts of your own.
